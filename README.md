# Adaptable Deep Learning Model for Artistic Style Transfer
Overview
This project focuses on the development of an adaptable deep learning model for artistic style transfer using PyTorch. It enables the blending of the artistic style from one image onto the content of another while offering flexibility and customization in the style transfer process.

Features
Adaptable Style Transfer: Incorporates an advanced algorithm to adapt the style of one image to the content of another.
Color-Aware Transfers: Special feature to consider color palettes and masks for more nuanced transfers.
Interactive Color Matching: Allows users to define color correlations between style and content images for personalized results.
Model Customization: Supports modifications to the underlying neural network model.
Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Installation
Install the necessary Python packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch numpy matplotlib pillow
Usage
Setup Images: Place the style and content images in a designated folder.

Configure the Script: Adjust parameters like image paths, model settings, and transfer options in the script.

Execute the Model:

bash
Copy code
python style_transfer_model.py
Output: The final stylized image will be displayed and can be saved.

Customization
Color Masks: Interactive session for matching colors between style and content images.
Model Choices: Options to switch between different neural network architectures.
Additional Notes
Ensure the compatibility of image sizes for best results.
Experiment with different style and content images for diverse artistic effects.
